Dear amazon,

I’m **very angry**, each time I try to quietly use your webservice there is **spam** for your “wonderful” service amazon premium (which naturally will make me spend **my** money).

I specifically asked to consumer service how to disable this shit and there is **zero** way to disable it.

Moreover, apparently it was **the first** to ask how to disable it. How could it be right ?

Your not happy consumer,

Xavier
